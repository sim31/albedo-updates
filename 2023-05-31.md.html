Currently all messages sent to firmchain contracts are stored in ipfs in format, where data field (main part of the message) is encoded. I think that big advantage that IPFS offers for firmchains is that we can use all the existing IPFS gateways as block explorers, if only we make the block data human-readable. Also I will need to decode that data at some point anyway.

So I'm now implementing encoding at firmnode level, based on the ABI of a contract (which is also on IPFS). All messages will be sent to firmnode in a decoded format and these messages will stored as files on IPFS in a decoded format.

Also doing quite a bit of refactoring. The interface of firmnode is becoming cleaner.
