Writing smart contract unit tests.

So far still stuck at smart contract deployment tests (testing contract constructor).

One of the things makes this hard is that hardhat does not provide a lot of helpful info for why tests are failing. The reason is probably related to the warning I'm seeing. Will try to fix tomorrow.

I'm also getting used to Typescript along the way (preferred language for tests in hardhat).

Plus these smart contracts that I wrote use a lot of encoding, which is not taken care of when interacting with smart contracts normally. Spent a lot of time just to create encoded objects to pass to constructor.

So it seems that testing will take a bit longer than expected...
