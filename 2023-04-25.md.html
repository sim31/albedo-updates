Fixed an issue with confirmations on older blocks. Previously contracts would mark the confirmer as faulty if it received its confirmation for a block which were already finalized. This would be an issue, because confirmations could be submitted later in L1 contexts.

Finished testing confirmation state. Started working on the frontend to start using the new firmcore module.
