Finally implemented deployment of firmchains at deterministic addresses. This means that firmchains will be able to have the same account address at all EVM chains. [It was already possible to deploy smart contracts at deterministic addresses in EVM chains](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2470), but I had to figure out how it would work for FirmChains and test it.

Using this feature DAOs could be founded without issuing a single transaction on-chain, while still being able to reserve an addresses in those chains. And it's the same address on all EVM chains.

Also did a lot of thinking (and writing) on architecture for firmament as a whole. Now integration between IPFS and EVM is becoming a lot clearer. Basically there will be a module, which will represent a node of firmchains and it will take care of retrieval and validation of the chain (meaning it will integrate both IPFS and EVM), while presenting the fronted with a very simple interface and types that is most easy for the typical frontend applications to use.
