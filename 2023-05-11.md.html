The new design will a node component (I call it [firmnode](https://github.com/sim31/firmnode)) which will be run locally by the user and that will run both IPFS node and EVM (in a form of ganache node currently). This is different from a previous design where ganache node was run within the browser. Already seeing huge performance benefits.

Today I worked on configuring ganache within firmnode, making sure it remembers it's state when restarted. Also updated how accounts are managed in the frontend. Adjusted frontend to work better for the version control use case, which as I mentioned yesterday is my main focus now.
