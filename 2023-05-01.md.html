Today I wanted to setup a linter for firmsignal, because previously I found multiple bugs, which linter could have prevented. Did that. Then did a lot of thinking about the best way to proceed to integrate IPFS to firmcore. Decided to start with a functionality to import / export chains and blocks as directories of json files. That will be a useful feature on its own, but it will also allow me to focus on the problem of how to serialize everything into a filesystem, without having to deal with IPFS at the same time. But will probably try to test some agregore functionality first.
