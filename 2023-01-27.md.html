Fractalgram is finally deployed! Here's the url: https://fractgram.web.app/

Today worked mostly on stuff related to deployment.

Changed icons, app name (in the tab and elsewhere) and versioning to be suited for this app. Had to change icons and the name, because of [Telegram API's terms of service](https://core.telegram.org/api/terms). But I'm really happy with the name "Fractalgram".
