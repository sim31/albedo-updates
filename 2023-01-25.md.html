Implemented a modal to edit a consensus results message. Additionally added modals to:
* Create account prompts (potentially for custom platforms);
* Specify platform for consensus results message;
* Specify group number;

This enables this tool more easily to be used by other fractals, which do not have a platform to submit, or have another frontend for submission (but the same url query string format).
