Added missing tests for a key part of FirmChain functionality: allowing other smart contracts to be confirmers (signers) so that FirmChains could be nested (hierarchy of FirmChains could be created).

Created a smart contract for a FirmChain-based DAO which uses Eden+Fractal process. It stores break-out room results (rankings and a delegate) from the last 4 weeks and it issues a token based on these results.
