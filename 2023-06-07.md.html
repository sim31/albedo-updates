# 2023-06-07 Overview of the current state of firmament project
Over the last couple of weeks I was trying to finish a proof-of-concept of firmament that I promised as a derivable of this season.

The current result is a web app that allows:
* creating firmchains;
* creating new blocks for them;
* sharing them on IPFS (through an IPFS node you run locally);
* Importing firmchains from IPFS and validating them;

Currently it all works in my development environment between my devices. [All source code is on github](https://github.com/sim31/firmsignal/tree/poc) and if you want to try it as well, please write here: https://t.me/chain_albedo

Previously I was planning to demonstrate and test this with more people (the app is for DAOs after all), but now I don't see much point. At this point it is already clear enough what needs to be changed, and those changes will require a rewrite of critical parts of the system. There's no point in testing things that are already obsolete.

Also, big part of initial motivation for this kind of PoC was to demonstrate user experience. Well, in the current version the user experience is really not good, and I don't need more testing in order to tell me that.

Some of the limitations of the current version:
* Speed
  * It replays the whole chain on each launching of the app. This means long loading times especially as the chains get longer. In general running [ganache node](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache) in the browser is quite slow.
  * Will have to reconsider how to run EVM in this project and save it's state;
* IPFS implementation
  * [Old Javascript implementation of IPFS recently got deprecated and replaced by another implementation](https://blog.ipfs.tech/state-of-ipfs-in-js/). This new implementation might enable browser-to-browser IPFS nodes, which was my preferred way of using IPFS in this project from the beginning;
* Directory structure
  * The plan is to store firmchains as directories on IPFS. Currently this is not done properly (doing it properly would have taken too much time for a PoC);
* No block discovery
  * Currently to find a new block of the chain created by someone else, you have to get a link from the to that new version of the chain. To implement *automatic* block discover properly I'll need to implement directory structure properly 
* Current implementation uses local Kubo node, which sometimes kills people's routers (they just stop and reboot usually). Something related to how many connections kubo node is trying to open. 

At this point, I think it is justified to move past the PoC stage and to focus on creating a usable product. So, even though I had more ambitious goals for the PoC (for it to prove the usability aspect), it ended up being only a technical proof-of-concept of some of the features that I committed to. But I learned enough in the process and feel like I'll actually save time by focusing on a long-term product as opposed to just proving feasibility.
