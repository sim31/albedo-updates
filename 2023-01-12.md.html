Working on pinning certain messages immediately after they are sent. It's a first test of new data flow I've been working on where information about messages that appear in the chat flows to components, so that they can compose new messages that make sense for the next steps of consensus. It's taking longer than expected, but once this is done, I think progress should be quicker.

Demonstrated last week's updates to consensus signalling app in the break-out rooms. Feedback seems mostly positive, except for some confusion regarding consensus hash. Will try to address this in the coming days.
