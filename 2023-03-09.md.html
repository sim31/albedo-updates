Yesterday, I prepared a presentation on firmament and how it relates to git, blockchains and IPFS. Topic was inspired during the previous meeting by people bringing up idea to use git for a fractal. I presented yesterday. You can see the slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14wQ9861ufLXCqdascm-ZW862qtEHArYzsI2vzvGwpVo/edit?usp=sharing).

Took some time today to finally fix very annoying bug in fractalgram, where it would trigger seemingly random actions when clicking unrelated elements in the UI. Was a very weird bug, caused by a change which seemed completely unrelated (removal of authentication by phone number screen). The current fix is kind of a hack, but it works for now. I hope to merge recent updates in the original telegram-tt into fractalgram. This might fix the bug. It also makes sense to merge these updates for the new topics feature of telegram.
