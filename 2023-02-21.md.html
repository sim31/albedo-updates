Finally running EVM in the browser!

Using ganache worked.

Also migrated from Create React App to Vite. The last motivating reason for doing so, was some imports of contract helpers I added to firmcontracts repository not working. And what do you know - after migrating to Vite, it started working perfectly. And reloads work much faster (besides other advantages of Vite).

Now I'm able to create a new firmchain (with a new genesis block) through the CreateChain form in firmsignal.
