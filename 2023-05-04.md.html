Fixed the issue related to uploading CAR files. Now I'm able to create CAR files, learn root CID of a directory this way and choose to upload the actual directory to IPFS later. This is the main advantage of using CAR files.

I'm considering to connect to IPFS node directly instead of using agregore:
* This way people can easily learn how to interact with their IPFS node, instead of it being hidden behind agregore;
* Agregore only launches IPFS node, once some IPFS content needs to be accessed. This would add to confusion;
* Launching a browser just to share content does not make much sense. Also requires more resources;
* More familiarity if people will be able to use their normal browsers;
* For some reason my computer sometimes hangs for a bit when starting agregore. Agregore also currently uses an older version of kubo (IPFS node);
