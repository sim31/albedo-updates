I'm now implementing all the details I skipped over in my drafts. 

Realized that I don't need DeviceChain. Chains controlled by keys will simply be modeled as a type of confirmer, which has to have a signature on a block it confirms. Other type of confirmer is a smart contract.

Implemented a fraud proof technique to prove that a fork has happened to the contract that manages the chain in question. This will make it possible for client blockchains [^1] to be aware of fork and stop updating the faulty chain. So other on-chain smart contracts that might be using fractal's state will stop using the fractal chain that is faulty.

Most recent work is now in [master branch](https://github.com/sim31/firmament-contracts/commits/master).

[^1]: By "client blockchains" I mean normal blockchains like Ethereum / EOS which will have these client smart contracts I'm currently creating, which will validate blocks and state of a fractal blockchain.
