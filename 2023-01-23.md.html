Implemented generation of results message:
![Figure [class-model]: results message](resources/results-msg.png style="max-width:600px")

Now have to test it a bit more. Considering also showing a modal where user could edit the results message he is sending.

<style class=fallback>body{visibility:hidden}</style><script>markdeepOptions={tocStyle:'long'};</script>
