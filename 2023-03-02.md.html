Forgot to mention yesterday, that I updated [Pomelo grant](https://pomelo.io/grants/albedo) description. Now I think it is clearer and more succinct.

On firmsignal (frontend for firmament) side I'm working on deriving all the needed information to display about the blocks. Thinking also about how caching will work (because currently the state of EVM which holds state of smart contracts is restarted every time the page is visited).
