Fixed an issue with detecting forks. Starting to test FirmChain (the core smart contract).

Exploring options about how these fractal chains could integrate with ENS and non-transferable token standards on Ethereum.

As I described in my [fractal blockchains post](https://peakd.com/fractally/@sim31/fractal-blockchains) it makes sense for fractal chains to name other contracts, websites, content on IPFS (give them human readable names). So it might make sense to integrate with projects which already work on naming solutions (like ENS). Would also provide a familiar interface to other Ethereum projects.
