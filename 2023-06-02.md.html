Today I finally implemented exporting and import FirmChains as CAR files ([content addressed archives](http://car.ipfs.io)) and as files on IPFS.  Made some tests on it and it seems to work well. This is a big step forward as it enables sharing chains between devices (and hence syncing). Now I only have to setup a frontend to manage content roots properly.
