Back to working on a frontend.

Designed a rough draft of an interface of firmcore, which is the new module I mentioned in the last update. It will be the module that integrates networking and storage with chain validation (it's like a core part of a blockchain node.

Creating an implementation of firmcore, which will mock the networking part and will only execute firmchains locally. Once the frontend will start working with this kind of mock, it should be easier to plug in real implementation with IPFS.
