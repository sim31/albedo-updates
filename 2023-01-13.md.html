Implemented sending messages which automatically get pinned. This will be helpful because if all consensus related messages are pinned, then pinned messages window will come in very handy when participants use chat a lot (so you won't have to scroll far to reach consensus messages - will be able to see all what's necessary in pinned messages window). I also tested the mechanism to detect specific messages (like consensus related ones), which I talked about in the previous updates.
