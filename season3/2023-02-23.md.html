Wrote tests for most of functionality of firmchains. Also for firmchain controlled directory (link to IPFS) and token (transferrable as well as not). Still a lot of edge cases to test but should be good enough to move forward with PoC.

While writing tests I ended up writing a lot of utility functions to help interact with firmchain smart contracts in JavaScript. This is one of the reasons I'm writing tests now - it will make work on the frontend smoother.
