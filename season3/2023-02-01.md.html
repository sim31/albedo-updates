Today I wrote an [introductory post for fractalgram](https://peakd.com/dao/@sim31/introducing-fractalgram). It explains how to use it in break-out rooms. Updated README and verstionNotification with links to this post. Also created a telegram group to collect feedback and discussions about this tool: https://t.me/+AgHQ4qT31qw0NDJk.
