I'm looking into how [hyper browser](https://github.com/hyperhyperspace/hyper-browser-web) works under hood. Especially how it manages state and hooks into react components and uses client side routing. FirmSignal app (frontend for firmament) will also be a kind of a browser, which will use hyper hyper space. So this will existing project will likely provide a template I will use to kickstart implementing functionality of firmsignal.
