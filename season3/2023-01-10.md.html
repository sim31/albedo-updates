I continue working on telegram-based consensus building tool. First iteration of it will be aimed to help individual break-out groups and will not implement creation of break-out groups themselves. To implement this, the client app needs to be aware when some special type of messages it has sent appear in the chat. Had to spend some time to form a better understanding data flows in the app in order to implement this properly.
