Fixed a couple of bugs in telegram:
* Ignoring some of the messages relevant to consensus when creating polls or consensus results message. This would happen in bigger chats, where not all messages would be loaded initially;
* Attaching images and files not working;

Will try to get people who reported them to test again to see if they are really fixed.
