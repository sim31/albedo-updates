Improved how poll results are shown in the app. Specifically for polls which are relevant for consensus, it now shows percentage based on number of people in the group instead of number of total votes. Besides it also shows `votes / groupSize` fraction.

Tested this tool in EdenFractal meeting yesterday. Gathering feedback from group members about it. I see a lot of stuff to improve, but I think it is much better than the previous methods we've been using.
