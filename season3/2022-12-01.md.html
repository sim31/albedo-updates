Today I continued work on API for firmament chains.

Basically I try to draft implementations of most common use cases of firmament I can imagine, and that gives me a picture of how good the API is (how easy it is to do stuff with it, if it is efficient, etc). I have draft implementations for device chain and an account chain, using an API I had in mind yesterday. But when I started drafting implementation for fractal DAO, I realized my previous idea was sub-optimal for large states and DAOs with many participants. Sub-optimal if we want these DAO chains to be validated by blockchains like Ethereum and EOS. For browsers I think it would work. But I already have a better design in mind. Will try it tomorrow.
