Yesterday I presented fractalgram in the EdenFractal meeting main room.

Working on FirmSignal (frontend for firmament). Decided to first design the pages as more or less static html and hookup the functionality later. So far I have the main app bar (displayed at the top of the page) and a form to create a new FirmChain.
