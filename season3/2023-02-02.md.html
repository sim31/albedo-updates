Since my intro post to fractalgram, some new people have been trying it and I've been helping them test. This of course uncovered some bugs. One of the more worrying issues is a bit of lag my break-out room experienced during the meeting (results showing up late). But this is unlikely to be caused by my tool. Most of the other bugs, I know how to fix.
