Somewhat finished implementation of chain for a single device and an account.

Smart contracts for these different chains will have a lot in common, and I'm already seeing that duplication. Today I was working on an interface for a contract that would implement most of the common functionality for all of these chains. It will basically be an API that different DAOs will use to implement specifics of their DAO. This work is in ["modular" branch](https://github.com/sim31/firmament-contracts/tree/modular).
